<li>LIONS</LI>
<p>Which are known of the kings of the jungle.Funny thing about it is they don't live in the jungle.Lions belong to the big cat family - lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars - and are the second largest big cat in the world after the tiger. Male lions usually live for between 10 to 12 years in the wild, but females can live up to the age of 14 or 15. In captivity lions have been known to live for 20 to 25 years. </p>

<li>ELEPHANTS</li>
<p>Although elephants are not dangerous animals, they fall under wild animals because they are way to big for a house. But they do get over protective when you interfere with their calf(baby elephant).Both male and female African elephants have tusks they use to dig for food and water and strip bark from trees. Males use the tusks to battle one another, but the ivory has also attracted violence of a far more dangerous sort. Because ivory is so valuable to some humans, many elephants have been killed for their tusks.</p>

<li>BEARS</li>
<P>A bear is 1 of the most dangerous animals alive. It's paw can kill you in 1 go.Bear danger is the risk encountered by humans and their pets or livestock when interacting with bears. Although most bears are alpha predators in their own habitat, most do not, under normal circumstances, hunt and feed on humans.</p>

<li>CROCODILES</li>
<p>The larger species of crocodiles can be very dangerous to humans. The Saltwater and Nile crocodiles are the most dangerous, killing hundreds of people each year in parts of South-East Asia and Africa.
  Crocodiles are closely related to dinosaurs and birds.</p>

<li>DINOSAURS</li>
<p>Last but not least is my favourite animal in the world.Dinosaurs walked the earth for over 165 million years. They lived during a period of time known as the Mesozoic Era, or Age of Reptiles. At the end of the Cretaceous Period they became extinct â€“ that was around 65 million years ago.</p>
