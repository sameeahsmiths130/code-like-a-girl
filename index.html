<h2>There are different types of animals, there are wild animals and tamed animals.</h2>

<p>1.A wild animal is an animal that is, well, wild. This means that it isn't tame and it lives on its own without any help from people. A wild animal finds its own food, shelter, water and all its other needs in a specific natural habitat.</p>
<p>Keeping wild animals in captivity is inherently cruel, as it deprives them of the ability to freely engage in instinctual behaviors in their natural environment. Even when bred in captivity, exotic animals retain all of their natural instincts.They cannot be considered "domesticated" or "tamed"<P>

<p>2.A tamed animal is a wild animal that has been taken “under the wings” of a human being, generally when it is very young. ... An animal that has been tamed is not a domestic animal and remains wild for its whole life.</p>
<p>Taming is the deliberate, human-directed process of training an animal against its initially wild or natural instincts to avoid (or attack) humans, so that it instead learns to become tolerant of humans. ... For example feral animals are domesticated, but not tamed.<p>
